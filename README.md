A pipeline for analyzing bacterial genomic sequences. Easily.

<p align="justify">
M1CR0B1AL1Z3R (pronounced: microbializer) was developed to facilitate large-scale microbial genomics analyses. Our aim was to make the analysis easily accessible to the scientific community, addressing the computational challenges of analyzing dozens of bacterial genomes simultaneously. These computations are resource-intensive; therefore, M1CR0B1AL1Z3R leverages high-performance computing clusters to run background processes in parallel. By doing so, it empowers researchers to preprocess and analyze massive genomic datasets without requiring costly computational infrastructure or specialized expertise. The tool generates both visual and textual outputs, ready for publication or further analysis.
