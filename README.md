A pipeline for analyzing bacterial genomic sequences. Easily.

<p align="justify">
M1CR0B1AL1Z3R (pronounced: microbializer) was developed in order to facilitate large scale microbial genomics analyses. Our goal was to make M1CR0B1AL1Z3R easily accessible to the scientific community and thus to allow handling computational challenges of analyzing dozens of bacterial genomes simultaneously. Such computations are highly demanding, and therefore, M1CR0B1AL1Z3R runs background computational processes in parallel on a high-performance computer cluster. To this end, M1CR0B1AL1Z3R enables the research community to preprocess and analyze massive genomic data that previously necessitated expensive computational infrastructure and expert knowledge. Both visual and textual results, ready for publication or downstream analysis, are given as an output.
